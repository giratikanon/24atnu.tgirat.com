			<p><p>how can you classify &#8220;partygoers&#8221; as elder girls who are going to a lame non-alcoholic frat party?  Talk to some girls who go to the deuce, the keg, and hundo on a normal basis. Is this whole documentary about how these ugly girls get dressed?  Random dance parties?? oh how cool.  </p>
<p>THE WHOLE THING WAS THEM GETTING READY. LAME.</p>

			<p><p>agreed with most of these comments&#8230; If they were actually at a party ( which i doubt) i would never talk to them. mostly because they play with their hair too much. but seriously, give nu some credit and interview people who actually go out!</p>

			<p><p>Yeah, this is a representation of one part of NU party scene&#8230;it may be the most popular (read: most plebeian) for freshman and/or freshman who live in elder and think they are social because of their residence, but how bout some fair and balanced journalistic coverage?  for this video I would have followed a person around from party to party or would have kicked the time back an hour or two and staked out part of a street and interviewed passersby.  that way we&#8217;d get a better cross section of parties at NU.</p>

			<p><p>good call mcL.  yes i give credit to these girls for allowing themselves to go on camera.  but to paraphrase the entry on stuff white people like about loving not having TVs&#8230;college girls love to have &#8220;random dance parties&#8221; less to actually have them and more to tell people later that they had a random dance party just to prove how spontaneous and awesome their lives must be.  the only place random dancing can break out is in musicals or, on occasion, in extremely well coordinated groups of dance majors.</p>

			<p><p>These girls are almost certainly way over McL&#8217;s head. Going to bars and staring at girls that wouldn&#8217;t give you the time of day doesn&#8217;t make you a party goer. You sound like a bitter loser.</p>

			<p><p>No&#8230;he sounds like a person who has actually experienced some of the social life at NU. Which, you will learn, doesn&#8217;t center around &#8220;dance parties lol&#8221; at frats. This is the most annoying freshman way of partying and while its fine that the video focused on it this is NOT a representation of NU&#8217;s social scene except for some ditzy freshmen. And umm, just fyi, going to bars is a lot more real than looking at yourself in the mirror and drinking warm beer in a frat house. McL is bitter because he doesn&#8217;t have the aWeSoMe life these girls do? Give me a break.</p>

			<p><p>As one of the girls in this video, I did NOT expect these malicious comments when I agreed to do this. First of all, McL, it is rude of you to call us ugly. Of course that is subjective, but if you see us in real life, I am 100% sure that you would think otherwise. Second, of COURSE this is a lame way that freshmen party at NU, but how can a Northwestern-affiliated blog videotape freshman going to bars. We are obviously under 21! Don&#8217;t assume that we don&#8217;t go to bars, and don&#8217;t assume that these parties are the highlight of our social lives. You don&#8217;t know us and it is IGNORANT of all of you to think that this ONE dance party represents our entire social life.<br />
Have some respect and understand that we did someone a FAVOR by agreeing to be videotaped. The purpose of this video was not to elicit rude judgements about our appearance and our mannerisms. If you don&#8217;t like us, DON&#8217;T WATCH US.</p>

			<p><p>Abhita: Let&#8217;s see what do we know about McL.. He sits in front of his computer and anonymously types insulting messages about attractive girls that he sees on the internet. Sounds like a real social success doesn&#8217;t he. Get the picture. I&#8217;m sure you knew losers like that in high school. Don&#8217;t pay any attention to McL and his buddies who came to his defense. There used to being ignored</p>

			<p><p>[...] Annoyingness factor: Depending on the frat, there is a full spectrum of extra-douche to so nice and undouchey you are perturbed, creeped out, and have to vacate the premise because if one more guy who was without a question on his high school debate team tells you your dress looks nice and offers you a drink, you might vomit. So try &#8216;em all and find what you like best. As for the girls you may encounter, watch this video. If it makes you want to gouge your eyes out, frat parties may not be your best bet. Score: 5 [...]</p>
