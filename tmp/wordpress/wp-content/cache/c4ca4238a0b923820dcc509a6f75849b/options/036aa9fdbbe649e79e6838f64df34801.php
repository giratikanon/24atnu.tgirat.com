Hooks are a set of custom written functions that can be added to existing functions in the WordPress core to increase, improve or remove functionality. WordPress plugins make extensive use of hooks to latch onto various portions of the WordPress themes or to the admin interface in order to provide the additional functionality or to perform certain actions in certain parts of the code. If you are looking to understand hooks, learn about all the action and filter hooks and all the deprecated hooks, find the latest changes and understand how hooks can be used in customizing WordPress, I suggest you look at Adam&#8217;s <a href="http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks">WordPress hooks database</a>.</p>

<p>Doing a bit of history, Gravatar has been around since <strong>at least 2004</strong>. At least that is as far back as the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://gravatar.com" target="_blank">Web Archive</a> has records of it which makes it all the more surprising that more services and software do not support it out of the box. For example, Twitter, Facebook, phpBB, all have their own way of handling avatars. No support what so ever for the Gravatar service, even though there are numerous examples of <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement" target="_blank">how to implement it</a>.</p>
<p>Could it be that we are really better off with each system managing avatars in their own way? Or is it the fact that most end users of various software and or services have not spoken loudly enough to have Gravatar support built in? My request is for software developers not to ditch their own avatar management solution, but to build Gravatar support in addition to. At least in this fashion, you could gauge how popular the use of Gravatar is to manage avatars on your software/service compared to your home grown solution opting to use one, the other, or both.</p>
<p>Gravatar is now hosted under the guide of Automattic, a company that has proven with WordPress.com that they know what they&#8217;re doing when it comes to scalability and server infrastructure. Users of bbPress, WordPress.com, and the self installed version of WordPress are spoiled to have Gravatar support built right into the software. To this day, I don&#8217;t think the Gravatar idea has come to fruition which is why I&#8217;m asking you to contact the developers of your favorite software or services which has its own version of avatar management and let them know you want Gravatar support to be built in. At the very least, a mod or plugin to add the functionality to the software should suffice. </p>

I briefly considered doing the same thing this year, updated with speculation about the upcoming versions 2.9 and 3.0, but that seemed like a cop-out. I wanted to do something a little deeper.</p>
<p>One of the things that always frustrates me about starting to work with a new programming language, or with a new framework for a language I already know, is the initial learning curve. Everybody wants to start out with the ubiquitous &#8220;Hello, World&#8221; example, which is great for a quick syntax example, but is pretty useless for practical purposes. I always want a good primer which doesn&#8217;t assume I&#8217;m a complete beginner, and dives right into useful examples. I want to know how to find the existing pieces of the system that are going to make my life easier. So I thought others might appreciate something like that for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> plugin programming.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s going to be my presentation topic this year. I&#8217;m going to try to create an introduction to creating plugins for WordPress. While there are bits of the process that can be complex, the real meat of the <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> hooks (filters and actions) are really pretty simple. And I think that with a good overview, those who aren&#8217;t already familiar with programming for WordPress can get up-to-speed more quickly than if they had to discover everything by searching the web and using trial-and-error. While I will try to keep things as simple as possible, I&#8217;m going to assume that my target audience will at least have a basic knowledge of programming concepts to include what functions and arrays are. You won&#8217;t have to be a <a href="http://php.net/"><acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym></a> expert, or even be able to sit down and write a program from scratch without a reference book handy.</p>
<p>I will, of course, make the presentation available online when the WordCamp arrives. And since I&#8217;ll be limited by time in my presentation, I&#8217;d like to publish an expanded version here later as a series of articles where I can go into more depth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already started a rough outline of what I want to cover. But I&#8217;d welcome any ideas or questions on this topic.

<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to highlight a number of different ideas, comments, and blog posts that came out of the discussion.</p>
<p>First, we have Matt Mullenweg who shares his thoughts on the idea that WordPress is a thankless community. This was a question and answer session at WordCamp Montreal where someone in the audience must have been reading WeblogToolsCollection.com. Who ever asked Matt this question, thank you! The question was asked at 33:40.</p>

<p>Thank plugin authors, link to them, credit them, try to be helpful on their forums, install WordPress for a neighbor.

<p>I have one more link that features an idea that I have really gotten behind called <a href="http://unfoldingneurons.com/2009/donate-friday" target="_blank">Donate Friday</a>. DonateFriday exists to socially show some love to plugin or theme authors every Friday. The way it works is you choose a theme or plugin author to donate to, place their name and a link to their plugin or theme in the tweet, and then add in the #donatefriday hashtag so that it can be tracked. I&#8217;ve participated in this event twice and it&#8217;s a cool way to not only show some love, but to spread the word of plugins you take value in. If you want to see it in action, check out the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23donatefriday" target="_blank">hashtag search</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I wanted to point you in the direction of a Codex article which discusses how to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress" target="_blank">contribute to WordPress</a> because much of the same material can be applied to theme and plugin authors. But the most interesting part of this page is the section describing the donation of money which is what I&#8217;ll leave you with to ponder.</p>
<blockquote><p>The WordPress Community exists because everyone takes part in some way, by giving their time, energy, and sometimes even money, because they believe in the valuable services WordPress provides. We invite you to join the community in whatever way you feel is appropriate, and giving money to WordPress Theme and Plugin authors and developers who give so freely of their creativity and expertise by offering their services for free to all WordPress users is a good place to start.</p>
<p>If you use a WordPress Theme or Plugin and your WordPress blog depends upon it, contact the author and find out how you can give back and support their continued efforts. It takes a lot of time and energy to create and then support their Themes and Plugins, keeping them updated as WordPress changes and bugs are found. Many take donations or appreciate it when you blog about their Plugin or Theme. Others offer their Plugins and Themes as experiential portfolios &#8211; you play with it, you like it, you hire them. Most clearly indicate how they appreciate compensation for their hard work &#8211; give back to WordPress by giving back to them.</p>
<p>The more the WordPress Community supports the programmers, developers, testers, and challengers, the stronger and better WordPress becomes. Sometimes that means donating money, sometimes it means saying thank you.</p>
<p>Just remember, every contribution counts, no matter what it looks like. It takes every one of us to make WordPress better. </p></blockquote>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sat, 15 Aug 2009 18:15:55 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";}s:7:"summary";s:5974:"<p>Back in early July, I asked the question <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/07/10/is-wordpress-a-thankless-community/">is WordPress a thankless community?</a> Not surprisingly, this post struck a chord with both developers and end users.

There <a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/9410">was no advanced warning</a> regarding the vulnerability but it was quickly patched in the core of WordPress for the next release. Unfortunately, word quickly spread and in fact, even my site <a href="http://www.wptavern.com">WPTavern.com</a> was affected by the problem as I received an email letting me know what my new password was even though I didn&#8217;t request one. Here are the details regarding the annoyance:</p>
<blockquote><p>a specially crafted URL could be requested that would allow an attacker to bypass a security check to verify a user requested a password reset. As a result, the first account without a key in the database (usually the admin account) would have its password reset and a new password would be emailed to the account owner. This doesn’t allow remote access, but it is very annoying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus WordPress 2.8.4. However, there are certain ways in which to respectfully report security vulnerabilities. An article on the vulnerability <a href="http://www.programmerfish.com/wordpress-security-flaw-reset-admin-password-of-any-blog-without-confirmation/">published by Programmerfish.com</a> in my opinion did more harm than good. The article discusses the vulnerability, explains how to put it in practice, then goes on to show some examples of the vulnerability in action which the author performed on sites they didn&#8217;t own. The author tries to justify his/her actions by stating that it was just a proof-of-concept. The author has taken plenty of heat from folks in the comments which I believe to be appropriate. </p>
<h2>The Correct Way:</h2>
<p>If you discover a security problem with WordPress, this is the correct way to go about it. If you believe you&#8217;ve found a security problem in a release of WordPress please send mail to <strong>security at the WordPress.org domain</strong> and we&#8217;ll do our best to address it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is standard practice to notify the vendor (the WordPress developers, in this case) of a security problem before publicizing so a fix can be prepared and public damage due to the vulnerability minimized. </p>

<p>If you have been using the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78483">Feedburner Feed Replacement Plugin</a> originally from <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">Steve Smith</a>, and have not checked your feeds lately, it might be worth a few minutes of your time to do so. Just browse to your blog&#8217;s feed address  (http://yourblog.com/feed/) and if you are redirected to your Feedburner feed, you are fine. Otherwise you need to uninstall the Feedburner plugin and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=feedburner">get something else</a>.</p>
<p>About a month ago, this blog&#8217;s feed count lost about 5000 readers in one feel swoop which is a huge number and a rude wake up call for us. This has happened before with Feedburner and I thought the count would go back up once Feedburner straightened out their data. But alas, that was not to be. I was relegated to thinking that either our posts have reduced so much in quality that people are unsubscribing in droves or there is some errant code on this blog somewhere. Even before this occurred, we had started putting more effort and resources into writing better articles and publishing more useful news for you. So I started trimming the fat (I had a bunch of stats javascripts and the like which are now gone, a good result of this exercise) and looking through plugins. Little did it occur to me that the Feedburner plugin might be the culprit.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I have not had the chance to figure out <em>why </em>the plugin stopped working but I did some research on the web and no-one seems to have noticed the problem. It might be an isolated case where my configurations or combination of plugins on this blog is causing the issue but I highly doubt it. The Feedburner plugin page says that the plugin works with <a href="http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78483">WordPress 2.5 and below</a>. I replaced that plugin with the one from John Watson and everything seems to be working fine again. The feed counts might not go up right away (we are putting more effort and resources into writing better articles and publishing more useful news for you) but I feel better knowing that everything is kosher on the feed side.</p>

Just browse to your blog&#8217;s feed address  (http://yourblog.com/feed/) and if you are redirected to your Feedburner feed, you are fine. Otherwise you need to uninstall the Feedburner plugin and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=feedburner">get something else</a>.</p>
<p>About a month ago, this blog&#8217;s feed count lost about 5000 readers in one feel swoop which is a huge number and a rude wake up call for us. This has happened before with Feedburner and I thought the count would go back up once Feedburner straightened out their data. But alas, that was not to be. I was relegated to thinking that either our posts have reduced so much in quality that people are unsubscribing in droves or there is some errant code on this blog somewhere. Even before this occurred, we had started putting more effort and resources into writing better articles and publishing more useful news for you. So I started trimming the fat (I had a bunch of stats javascripts and the like which are now gone, a good result of this exercise) and looking through plugins. Little did it occur to me that the Feedburner plugin might be the culprit.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I have not had the chance to figure out <em>why </em>the plugin stopped working but I did some research on the web and no-one seems to have noticed the problem. It might be an isolated case where my configurations or combination of plugins on this blog is causing the issue but I highly doubt it. The Feedburner plugin page says that the plugin works with <a href="http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78483">WordPress 2.5 and below</a>. I replaced that plugin with the one from John Watson and everything seems to be working fine again. The feed counts might not go up right away (we are putting more effort and resources into writing better articles and publishing more useful news for you) but I feel better knowing that everything is kosher on the feed side.</p>
<p>Do you use the Feedburner Feed Replacement Plugin? Was feed broken? What other Feedburner plugins do you use and like?</p>";}i:38;a:6:{s:5:"title";s:39:"Dougal Campbell: Analytics Observations";s:4:"guid";s:33:"http://dougal.gunters.org/?p=1622";s:11:"description";s:10772:"<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve variously either obsessed over or ignored my site stats.

On the first day of a new WordPress post, my site typically sees 2-3 times as many hits as it does during a quiet phase when I haven&#8217;t posted in a while. This usually tapers off over the course of the next few days until traffic returns to ambient levels. So you&#8217;d expect that over time, those posts would stay on top of the list of most visited articles on this site. However, I&#8217;ve found some exceptions that surprised me.</p>

<p>First, take a look at my traffic graph for the month of July 2009. Those orange dots are when I made blog posts. As I said, the traffic spike is pretty obvious. This is the result of several hundred people clicking in from their WordPress Dashboard, or to a lesser degree from <acronym title="Rich Site Summary"><span class="caps">RSS</span></acronym> aggregators like <a href="http://google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>.</p>

<p>Now you can watch <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2009/07/26/introducing-gravatar-your-globally-recognized-avatar/">Gravatar, the motion picture</a>!  Which was put together by the ever helpful <a href="http://wordpress.tv/producer/michael-pick/">Michael Pick</a>.  If you&#8217;ve ever had trouble explaining exactly what Gravatar.com does to your friends, family, neighbors, long lost friends, and that dude down the street, then this is the screen cast for you!</p>
<h3>404 Gravatar Not Found?!</h3>
<p>It may not be a groundbreaking feature, but there is some a small new addition to the Gravatar API. You can now specify a default value of 404 to make the image&#8230; well&#8230; return a 404 not found error if there is no image for the given email address. This probably wont change the life of you website developers out there, but it just might make it easier for you application developers (you know&#8230; the people who have to actually compile their code before it works&#8230;)</p>
<h3>Did You Know?</h3>
<p>Today we have TWO &#8220;Did you know&#8221; tidbits for the price of one.</p>
<ol>
<li>This little tidbit is often a surprise for developers to find out, but you can use https://secure.gravatar.com/ [...] to link to an SSL encrypted Gravatar.  This is especially useful when linking using Gravatars from SSL encrypted web pages.</li>
<li>You can pre-fill the email address in sign up form for Gravatar.com to make it a little bit easier for your users to know what to do. Just add the email address to the end of the sign up URL <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/signup/my%40email.com">like so</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sightings in the Wild</h3>
<ol>
<li>Where.com&#8217;s &#8220;WHERE wall&#8221; web service has been <a href="http://www.where.com/words/using-where/how-to-post-an-avatar-to-the-where-wall/">using Gravatars</a> since the word &#8220;GO&#8221; for displaying user avatars.  They had one small hiccup, but we got in contact with the developers (who were super nice and down to earth, by the way) to get the situation rectified.</li>
<li>We recently heard that <a href="http://domelhor.net">doMelhor</a> (which, I&#8217;m told, is the leading Portuguese digg clone) recently enabled Gravatar support for avatar display.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have for now but, as always, there is more to come from Gravatar.com</p>

<p>Rather than use commercial services like Google Docs, Google Groups or Multiply we thought it would be much more functional to build our own site and customize it to our preferences. I volunteered to get that site up and running and I was actually able to have something online overnight that met our needs.  It really proved just how flexible WordPress is and how talented the plug-in developer community is to be able to provide such a wide range of functionality with plug-ins.</p>
<p>After getting our domain registered I got the latest version of WordPress (2.8.3) uploaded and installed. If you have ever set up a brand new WordPress site then you know how easy and quick the 5 minute install is.</p>
<p>After spending some time tweaking all the everyday settings for the blog I started off with a search for a theme that would support the mix of PC and Mac people that were  involved. The one I finally settled on is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/iblog2">iBlog2</a> by Andrew Powers.  I picked it because the layout is very clean and it is compatible with popular browsers on both the Windows and Mac operating systems.</p>
<p>The next thing I went in search for was a calendar/event plug-in that we could use to keep track of upcoming shows, meeting coordination, travel schedules and other events for the show.  I must have tried 3 or 4 plug-ins before I finally settled on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/event-calendar/">Event Calendar 3 by Alex Tingle</a> (91,000 downloads). This plug-in also utilizes the Event Calendar Widget by Darrell Schulte which provides the sidebar calendar widget that interfaces with the Event Calendar 3 plug-in. This plug-in creates an additional editing box at the very bottom of the Post Page that lets you select a start and end date/time for an event. </p>
<p>Here is what that Event Editor box looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/eventeditor.png"><img title="eventeditor" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/eventeditor_thumb.png" border="0" alt="eventeditor" width="312" height="50" /></a></p>
<p>Then you put the subject line as the event name and type any further details in the post. What you get then is a positing that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/eventposting.png"><img title="eventposting" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/eventposting_thumb.png" border="0" alt="eventposting" width="308" height="90" /></a></p>
<p>And that in turn shows up on the sidebar calendar widget as a highlighted day in red and if you hover over the date you will see the event in a small pop-up box:</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/eventcalendarpopup.png"><img title="eventcalendarpopup" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/eventcalendarpopup_thumb.png" border="0" alt="eventcalendarpopup" width="244" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>The next thing we wanted to be able to do was share files on the site and I immediately went for a plug-in I am already familiar with and grabbed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/download-monitor/">Wordpress Download Monitor</a> plug-in by Mike Jolley which I use on my <a href="http://www.windowsobserver.com/">WindowsObserver.com</a> website to host a selection of <a href="http://www.windowsobserver.com/downloads/">Windows 7 Themes</a>. It is another very simple to use plug-in that has great functionality, flexibility as well as stats tracking for all downloadable files. It has been downloaded 95,000 times so it is also in wide use and obviously popular.</p>
<p>That wrapped up the bulk of the functionality we needed within the site – the next thing was to lock it down for our own private use. After trying a few plug-ins I found many were either dated in their development or not able to meet our needs.  It was then that I happened upon the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/absolute-privacy/">Absolute Privacy plug-in</a> by John Kolbert.  This is a fairly new plug-in that has only been available since Feb 2009 and with just over 3,300 downloads to its name.</p>
<p>However, don’t let that low number lull you into thinking it is not well made and good at its intended use.</p>
<p>This plug-in has one main option – to either enable or disable the plug-in:</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/enableabsoluteprivacy.png"><img title="enableabsoluteprivacy" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/enableabsoluteprivacy_thumb.png" border="0" alt="enableabsoluteprivacy" width="308" height="51" /></a></p>
<p>It gives you a new user category – Unapproved User – and this is assigned to anyone who signs up for an account so an Admin can approve or disapprove someone&#8217;s access to the site.  Once they are approved you can assign them to whatever level of access they need. At that point their access to the site functions like it would on any other WordPress site except they must be signed in to see/access the entries, admin panel, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/mustlogintothissite.png"><img title="mustlogintothissite" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/mustlogintothissite_thumb.png" border="0" alt="mustlogintothissite" width="225" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>Using this plug-in your site is locked down quite well and even the RSS feeds are inaccessible unless your logged in.</p>
<p>So there you have it – with an idea, a handful of plug-ins and some time you can also build your own personal and private collaboration site with WordPress.</p>
<p>So for discussion &#8211; what is the most unique, non-traditional site you have ever built with WordPress?</p></blockquote>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 09 Aug 2009 11:40:00 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:15:"WindowsObserver";}s:7:"summary";s:6283:"<blockquote><p>I work with a group of people in the development and production of a podcast called <a href="http://pcmacsmackdown.com/">The PC/Mac Smackdown</a>.  The show is going through significant changes in the near future and we decided it would be great to have some type of collaborative site for us to share ideas, files, schedules, etc.</p>
<p>Rather than use commercial services like Google Docs, Google Groups or Multiply we thought it would be much more functional to build our own site and customize it to our preferences. I volunteered to get that site up and running and I was actually able to have something online overnight that met our needs.  It really proved just how flexible WordPress is and how talented the plug-in developer community is to be able to provide such a wide range of functionality with plug-ins.</p>
<p>After getting our domain registered I got the latest version of WordPress (2.8.3) uploaded and installed. If you have ever set up a brand new WordPress site then you know how easy and quick the 5 minute install is.</p>

<p>WordPress MU 2.8.3 is a security and bugfix release based on the fixes in <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3dvcmRwcmVzcy5vcmcvZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvMjAwOS8wOC93b3JkcHJlc3MtMi04LTMtc2VjdXJpdHktcmVsZWFzZS8=">WordPress 2.8.3</a> but also contains many other <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3RyYWMubXUud29yZHByZXNzLm9yZy9sb2cvYnJhbmNoZXMvMi44P2FjdGlvbj1zdG9wX29uX2NvcHkmIzAzODttb2RlPXN0b3Bfb25fY29weSYjMDM4O3Jldj0xOTI3JiMwMzg7c3RvcF9yZXY9MTg5OCYjMDM4O2xpbWl0PTEwMCYjMDM4O3ZlcmJvc2U9b24=">changes</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a required upgrade for security reasons but also fixes a number of annoying bugs, especially <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3RyYWMubXUud29yZHByZXNzLm9yZy90aWNrZXQvMTA2Nw==">#1067</a> and <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3RyYWMubXUud29yZHByZXNzLm9yZy90aWNrZXQvMTA3Ng==">#1076</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the automatic upgrader in MU 2.8.2 is broken but it&#8217;s simple to fix:</p>
<ul>
<li> Before upgrading, edit wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php and look for line 697.<br />
<blockquote>if ( !$wp_filesystem->copy($working_dir . &#8216;/wordpress/wp-admin/includes/update-core.php&#8217;, $wp_dir . &#8216;wp-admin/includes/update-core.php&#8217;, true) ) {</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li> See the &#8220;/wordpress/wp-admin/includes&#8221; bit? Change that to &#8220;/wordpress-mu/wp-admin/includes&#8221;:<br />

</li>
<li> Save the file and auto upgrade. I upgraded this afternoon without a hitch after making that change. It&#8217;s fixed in 2.8.3 so it&#8217;s the last time you&#8217;ll have to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do not copy and paste the line above as WordPress will have changed the quotes to &#8220;smart quotes&#8221;. Actually go in and type &#8220;-mu&#8221; after &#8220;wordpress&#8221;. No copy and pasting please!</em></p>
<p>If auto upgrading still doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t sweat it. Download the new release from the <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL211LndvcmRwcmVzcy5vcmcvZG93bmxvYWQv">download page</a> and upgrade manually, overwriting your current install with the new files.</p>
