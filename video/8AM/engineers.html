about the different concentrations of 
engineering at Northwestern


Biomedical Engineering


<p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><b>Alexander Sheu ('09): </b><i>Biomedical engineering lets you look at biology from a <sbr />more analytical, systematic perspective. Surprisingly, a lot of biological <sbr />phenomena can be modeled by mathematical expressions.</i></font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><i>I'm a HPME student, so I will be going to medical school after I finish my <sbr />undergraduate studies next year. &nbsp;I think to be an engineer before becoming a <sbr />doctor allows you better understand the mechanical, chemical, and biological <sbr />technologies of our bodies.</i></font></p>
Develops tools to improve patient 
care and research techniques


Applied Mathematics


Applies mathematical techniques to engineering or 
scientific problems; graduates enter fields of pure or 
applied mathematics or engineering, including 
computer science


Chemical Engineering


Analyzes and designs large scale manufacturing 
processes involving physical, chemical and 
biochemical transformation


Civil Engineering


<p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><b>Jon Altenhofen ('09): </b><i>Civil engineering, here at Northwestern, breaks <sbr />down into four specializations: &nbsp;structural, environmental, geotechnical and <sbr />construction management</i></font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><i>Personally, I am interested in the structural and construction management <sbr />specialties and would like to get into structural design, architecture, urban <sbr />planning, or construction managem</i><b>ent.</b></font></p>
Constructs and operates public infrastructure, 
such as roads or airports, through research, 
design and management


Environmental Engineering


<p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><b>Kara McKenzie ('09):</b> <i>It affords us the opportunity to make a difference <sbr />in the world. Whether it's working in a third world country to provide a <sbr />safe water supply or cleaning up super-fund sites right here on U.S. soil, <sbr />there is so much potential to enact positive change in the world through <sbr />environmental engineering.</i></font></p>
Shields environment from harmful effects of human activities; protects 
humans from negative environment impacts like floods; restore 
environment for mutual well being between it and humans


Computer Science 


<p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><b>Stacy Devino ('09): </b><i>We are the people who make computer chips, <sbr />operating systems, and technology work together. The Electrical <sbr />Engineers may come up with a piece of hardware, the Computer <sbr />Scientists come up with software. Unfortunately, there really are not <sbr />many girls in this field and I would wager that we have the lowest <sbr />percentage of females.</i></font></p>
Computer science: Focuses on computer programming, 
information technology, computer graphics, computer systems, 
human computer interaction among many other disciplines


Computer Engineering 


Works with digital design, computer hardware, 
microprocessors, software and programming


Electrical Engineering


Helen Kim ('08): It is actually a very broad field. It could be divided up to 
five different areas, and usually students concentrate on one or two.
- Circuit Analysis (circuits and power controls)
- Solid State Engineering (semiconductors, quantum mechanics, etc. )
- Signal systems & Communication Network (AM/FM, Analog-to-Digital, 
Internet Networks)
- Optics (Electromagnetics, lasers)
- Control Systems (Feedback control)
A lot of my peers are continuing their studies at graduate school and I 
think only a handful of people jump into industry right away.


Applies optical and electronic technologies for processing, 
generating and communication information


Mechanical Engineering


<p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><b>Jason Songer ('08):</b><i> Mechanical Engineering is a very wide field. <sbr />Anything from fluid flow to heat transfer to interconnecting machine parts. <sbr />We pretty much study how everything works together and how to use that <sbr />to create a usable product. I am focusing on the design aspect, so I hope <sbr />to use my degree to design products for industry. Pretty much I hope to <sbr />take customer requirements and use my knowledge to turn it into a <sbr />product that is easy to make and use.</i></font></p>
Combines conceptual design with analysis, 
manufacturing, experimentation and testing; 
encompasses fields from robotics to tribology


Materials Science


Applies science to develop information 
technology, transportation, consumer 
products and biomaterials


Manufacturing and Design


Works with product design, manufacturing 
systems and manufacturing management


<p align="left"><font face="_sans" size="14" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="0"><b>Taarif Jafferi ('08):</b><i> I view manufacturing and design engineering as the <sbr />teachings of how to creatively and effectively design a product to meet a <sbr />certain aesthetic or functional purpose while ensuring ease of <sbr />manufacturing. Though I initially plan to go into the consulting field, my wish <sbr />is to later use my MaDE knowledge and join a product design and <sbr />development firm.</i></font></p>
Industrial Engineering


Concerned with efficient production; designs methods, not machinery. Jobs 
include plant layout, analysis and planning of workers' jobs, economical handling 
of raw materials and the efficient control of the inventory of finished products.
